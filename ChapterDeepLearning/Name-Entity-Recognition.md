Non-trivial part of the problem
---
not just tagging each word by a class from a current database; instead we may encounter words without any prior knowledge and have to tag them using contextual information, such as `EU`

Steps
---
1. for each word we need to use a dense representation $w \in R^n$

End Product

1. a blog post with Toronto twitter data

2. a video presentation 

3. a MOOC

4. interviews and conferences
